# TableFlow

App written in JavaScript using p5.js library.  
Inspired by Daniel Shiffamn's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl3nc_a1nvs&t=217s  
  
Short word about options in the app:  
-Corners: Number of corners of Poligon, 0 for circle  
-Max mult/Starting mult: edge multiplication parameters (animation is kind of loop)  
-Num of lines: quite obvious  (from 30 to 450)  
-Anim speed: increment or decrement of multiplication after each frame  
-Base point: place where the '0' is on the edge of poligon (0 - middle of edge; 1 - corner)  
-Edge: Show the white circumference of the figure  
-Saturation/Opacity: Parameters of the lines
